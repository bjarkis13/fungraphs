	<p> For some years there has been talk of the depopulation of smaller municipalities in Iceland. <br> This site was created in order to examine the causes of these migrations and their symptoms. Furthermore the extent of these migration can be seen on an interactive map.
	</p>
    <p> All population data is normalized such that we map census numbers to the current municipality that those people would dwell in today.
    Some estimations had to be made prior to 1948 since municipalities were still dissolvind. When for example an old municipality lies within two or more municipalities today.
    Since then only mergers have occurred so all data from 1950s onward should be correct.
